Hello everyone! Today I want to share an exciting update â€” I've integrated DeepAgents into ChatOllama, bringing powerful deep research capabilities to our open source AI chat application.

## What is DeepAgents?

Before diving in, let me introduce DeepAgents. Traditional AI agents typically use a simple "LLM + tool calling" approach. While capable of handling basic tasks, they often fall short when facing complex, multi-step research work. These "shallow" agents lack planning capabilities and cannot effectively decompose and execute complex tasks.

DeepAgents changes this paradigm. Drawing inspiration from successful applications like Claude Code and Deep Research, it builds truly "deep" agents through four core components:

### 1. **Planning Module** ðŸ§ 
- **Task Decomposition**: Breaks complex research questions into manageable sub-tasks
- **Strategy Selection**: Chooses optimal approaches based on task characteristics
- **Resource Assessment**: Evaluates required tools and information sources

### 2. **Tool Integration** ðŸ”§
- **Web Search**: Real-time information gathering from multiple sources
- **Document Processing**: Analysis of uploaded files and documents
- **API Integration**: Connection to external services and databases
- **Code Execution**: Running analysis scripts and data processing

### 3. **Memory System** ðŸ’¾
- **Context Persistence**: Maintains conversation context across long research sessions
- **Information Synthesis**: Combines findings from multiple sources intelligently
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors research progress and adjusts strategies

### 4. **Quality Control** âœ…
- **Source Verification**: Cross-references information from multiple sources
- **Fact Checking**: Validates claims against reliable databases
- **Bias Detection**: Identifies potential biases in research findings

## Integration Architecture

### System Design

The ChatOllama-DeepAgents integration follows a modular architecture:

```typescript
interface DeepAgentConfig {
  tools: ToolDefinition[];
  instructions: string;
  model: ChatModel;
  subAgents?: SubAgent[];
  memoryConfig: MemorySettings;
}

class ChatOllamaAgent {
  constructor(private config: DeepAgentConfig) {
    this.initializeAgent();
  }

  async processResearchQuery(query: string): Promise<ResearchResult> {
    const plan = await this.createResearchPlan(query);
    const results = await this.executeResearch(plan);
    return this.synthesizeFindings(results);
  }
}
```

### Key Features

#### 1. **Streaming Research Process**

## Implementation Highlights

### Smart Tool Selection

```typescript
class ToolOrchestrator {
  async selectOptimalTools(query: string): Promise<Tool[]> {
    const queryType = await this.classifyQuery(query);
    const availableTools = this.getAvailableTools();

    switch (queryType) {
      case 'factual':
        return [webSearch, knowledgeBase, factChecker];
      case 'analytical':
        return [dataProcessor, webSearch, calculator];
      case 'creative':
        return [webSearch, imageSearch, trendAnalyzer];
      default:
        return this.getDefaultToolset();
    }
  }
}
```

### Progressive Result Building

```typescript
class ResearchOrchestrator {
  async conductResearch(query: string): Promise<ResearchResult> {
    const findings = [];

    // Phase 1: Initial information gathering
    const initialResults = await this.gatherInitialData(query);
    findings.push(...initialResults);

    // Phase 2: Deep dive based on initial findings
    const deepResults = await this.conductDeepAnalysis(initialResults);
    findings.push(...deepResults);

    // Phase 3: Synthesis and validation
    const synthesized = await this.synthesizeFindings(findings);
    const validated = await this.validateFindings(synthesized);

    return this.formatFinalReport(validated);
  }
}
```
